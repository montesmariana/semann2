# semann2
New and improved version of annotation tool

With this tool, that could certainly be pretty and probably more functional, you can upload your concordances, define variables and annotate with fun star ratings, buttons, numbers, etc.
Better description coming in the near future!

Installation files and an example of a concordance and a categorical variable can be found [here](https://github.com/montesmariana/semann2/tree/master/download)
